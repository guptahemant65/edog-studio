## 1. Why This Exists

FLT engineers currently have **no way to test failure scenarios** without:
- Waiting for a real production outage
- Manually breaking PPE resources (and praying they can fix them)
- Writing unit test mocks that don't reflect real behavior
- Asking another team to throttle their endpoint

EDOG Studio already has **11 interceptors running inside FLT's process**. They observe every token acquisition, every HTTP call, every file write, every Spark session, every feature flag evaluation. Today they're read-only — they feed the Runtime View tabs.

The Chaos Engineering Panel **upgrades these observers into actors**. Same interceptors, same positions in the pipeline — but now they can delay, modify, block, redirect, and forge traffic.

**The key insight:** We're not building an external proxy. We're **inside the process**. We have access to the DI container, the auth context, the execution state, and every byte flowing in and out. No other chaos tool in the world has this position.

---

## 2. What The User Sees

The Chaos Panel is a new view in EDOG Studio (5th sidebar item, or a sub-panel inside Runtime). It has 4 sub-views:

### 2.1 Rule Builder
The user creates "chaos rules" — each rule says: "When you see a request matching X, do Y to it."

Example rules a user would create:
- "Delay all OneLake writes by 3 seconds" — tests timeout handling
- "Return 429 for 30% of Spark calls" — tests retry logic under partial failure
- "Replace the MWC token audience from `onelake.dfs` to `api.fabric`" — tests auth validation
- "Drop every 5th request to the Orchestrator" — tests heartbeat resilience
- "Return a 200 with empty JSON body for table listing calls" — tests null handling

The rule builder has:
- **Predicate section:** match by URL pattern (regex/glob), HTTP method, header values, body content, named HttpClient, request direction (outbound/inbound), probability (0-100%)
- **Action section:** delay (ms), modify status code, modify headers, modify body (JSONPath), redirect URL, block (return error), forge response (full replacement)
- **Lifecycle section:** max firings (fire N times then auto-disable), duration (active for N minutes), schedule (enable at specific time)
- **Safety section:** kill switch (Ctrl+Shift+K disables ALL rules instantly), auto-disable if FLT process CPU >90%, undo last rule

### 2.2 Active Rules List
Shows all active rules with:
- Rule name + description
- Match count (how many times it's fired)
- Last fired timestamp
- Enable/disable toggle (instant, no restart)
- Visual indicator: green = active, amber = rate-limited, red = error, grey = paused

### 2.3 Traffic Monitor
A live stream of all HTTP traffic flowing through FLT, showing:
- Timestamp
- Method + URL (truncated, expandable)
- Status code (color-coded: 2xx green, 4xx amber, 5xx red)
- Duration (ms)
- Which rules matched this request (if any)
- Which interceptor processed it
- Click to expand: full headers, body preview, timing breakdown

This is Burp Suite's HTTP History tab — but running inside the service process.

### 2.4 Recording & Playback
- One-click "Start Recording" — captures all traffic to a HAR-like file
- Stop recording → browse the captured traffic
- Export as HAR 1.2 (importable in Chrome DevTools)
- Compare two recordings ("before my change" vs "after my change")
- Import a recording as a mock data source (response cache mode)

```

### 3.1 Zero-Overhead Fast Path

When no chaos rules are active (99% of the time), the engine adds ZERO overhead:

```csharp
// In EdogHttpPipelineHandler.SendAsync():
if (!ChaosRuleEngine.HasActiveRules)  // volatile bool, branch-predicted true
{
    return await base.SendAsync(request, ct);  // fast path: no evaluation
}
```

### 3.2 Rule Evaluation (when rules ARE active)

Rules are stored in an **immutable snapshot** — the evaluator reads a snapshot reference (single volatile read, no lock) and iterates rules sequentially. For N rules:
- Best case: O(1) — first predicate fails fast (URL prefix check)
- Worst case: O(N) — all predicates evaluated
- Expected: N < 10 active rules, each with 1-2ms evaluation = ~10ms overhead max

### 3.3 Safety

- **Ctrl+Shift+K** — global kill switch, disables ALL rules, clears the snapshot, logged
- **Auto-disable** — if FLT process throws an unhandled exception while rules are active, ALL rules auto-disable
- **Max firings** — each rule has a configurable max (default: unlimited, but user can set 1, 10, 100)
- **Duration** — rules can have a TTL: "active for 5 minutes then auto-disable"
- **Audit log** — every rule creation, modification, activation, deactivation, and firing is logged with timestamp and user context

## 7. Implementation Order (AFTER all prep is done)

```
Layer 0: ChaosRuleEngine C# class (rule model + store + evaluator)
Layer 1: Upgrade EdogHttpPipelineHandler (integrate engine into SendAsync)
Layer 2: SignalR messages (rule CRUD + traffic events)
Layer 3: Frontend panel shell + rule list
Layer 4: Rule builder UI
Layer 5: Traffic monitor UI  
Layer 6: Category-specific actions (one PR per category)
Layer 7: Recording + HAR export
Layer 8: Advanced features (DSL, presets, scheduled chaos)
```

Each layer is independently testable. Each layer is one commit.

---

## 8. Success Criteria

An FLT engineer opens the Chaos Panel and within 30 seconds:
1. Creates a rule: "Delay OneLake writes by 3 seconds"
2. Runs a DAG
3. Sees the delay reflected in the traffic monitor
4. Sees the DAG take longer
5. Disables the rule
6. Runs the DAG again — back to normal

That's the MVP. Everything else builds on top.
